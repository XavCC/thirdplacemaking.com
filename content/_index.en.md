  title: Making the world as a third place
  text: |-
    Third places, where sociability is exercised, are of major importance in our democratic societies. Throughout history, they have always been places where people gathered to create, entertain, discuss, criticise, challenge, disagree, exchange, resolve or cooperate.

    Today these places, all over the world, are subject to many restrictions and are under all kinds of pressures. By undermining third places, the civil rights of communities are targeted.

    Third Place Making is a Swiss foundation whose mission is to strengthen third places and their communities around the world. We are committed to ensuring that every person and every community can access, create or preserve a third place to meet, exchange, strategise, build projects, or simply appreciate the joy of being together.

    After all, we have always remade the world through third places.
